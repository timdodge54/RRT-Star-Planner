    "## Problem 1: Forming Numpy Matrices\n",
    "We will work quite heavily with numpy matrices. A numpy matrix can be created in a host of ways, but the most straight forward is to use the `np.array` initializer. In this case, each row of the matrix is initialized using an array and the matrix is an array of arrays. For example, the following matrix\n",
    "$ex_{mat} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6  \\end{bmatrix}$ can be initialized as\n",

    "Now, extract the middle column of `ex_mat` using the slice notation (i.e., `ex_mat[:,0]` gives all rows of the first column). Print the column. Print the shape of `ex_mat` (i.e., `ex_mat.shape`). Print the shape of the extracted middle column. **Note** that the column has lost a dimension! This can cause issues when using numpy as you may have expected the shape of the column to be `(2,1)`, but it is `(2,0)`. Do the same thing for the bottom row of the matrix (using slice notation, `-1` denotes the last element). **Note** that the row has a seemingly weird shape as well. Instead of being `(1,3)` it is `(3,)`."
